# Project Architecture

This project follows a feature-based architecture, inspired by the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology. This approach helps to organize code in a scalable and maintainable way, especially for large React applications.

### Explanations for the expanded structure:

1. **app/**
   - `layout.tsx`: Main application layout
   - `page.tsx`: Home page
   - `styles/globals.scss`: Global styles
   - `fonts/`: Directory with font files

2. **entities/**
   - `User/`: User entity
     - `model/types.ts`: User data types
     - `ui/UserCard.tsx`: User card component
     - `api/userApi.ts`: User-related API requests
   - `Project/`: Project entity
     - `model/types.ts`: Project data types
     - `ui/ProjectCard.tsx`: Project card component

3. **features/**
   - `Auth/`: Authentication functionality
     - `ui/LoginForm.tsx`: Login form
     - `ui/RegisterForm.tsx`: Registration form
     - `model/useAuth.ts`: Hook for managing authentication state
   - `ProjectList/`: Project list functionality
     - `ui/ProjectList.tsx`: Project list component
     - `model/useProjects.ts`: Hook for managing project data

4. **shared/**
   - `ui/`: Common UI components
     - `Button/Button.tsx`: Reusable button component
     - `Input/Input.tsx`: Reusable input component
   - `lib/api.ts`: Common functions for working with API
   - `assets/icons/logo.svg`: Common resources such as icons

5. **views/**
   - `HomePage/HomePage.tsx`: Home page component
   - `ProjectPage/ProjectPage.tsx`: Project page component

6. **widgets/**
   - `Header/Header.tsx`: Website header component
   - `Footer/Footer.tsx`: Website footer component

This expanded structure demonstrates how different parts of the application can be organized according to the architectural approach. Each directory contains files and subfolders that are logically related and correspond to the purpose of that architectural layer.

### App

The `app/` directory contains the main application setup, including:
- Global styles
- Root layout
- Main page components
- Font configurations

### Entities

The `entities/` directory is for business entities in the project. These are the core building blocks of your application's domain model.

Example: User, Product, Order

### Features

The `features/` directory contains feature-specific components and logic. These are usually more complex than entities and may combine multiple entities to create a specific feature.

Example: UserProfile, ProductList, OrderCheckout

### Shared

The `shared/` directory is for common utilities, components, and helpers that are used across multiple features or entities.

Example: Button component, date formatting utility, API service

### Views

The `views/` directory contains page-level components that compose features and entities into full pages or screens.

Example: HomePage, ProductDetailsPage, CheckoutPage

### Widgets

The `widgets/` directory is for complex UI components that may include business logic but are not tied to a specific feature.

Example: Header, Footer, Sidebar, NotificationPanel

## Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer (entity, feature, widget, etc.) has its own responsibility and should not depend on layers above it.

2. **Reusability**: Lower layers (shared, entities) should be more reusable than higher layers (features, views).

3. **Encapsulation**: Each feature or entity should encapsulate its own state and logic.

4. **Composition**: Higher-level components (views, widgets) should compose lower-level components (entities, features) rather than implement business logic directly.

5. **Scalability**: This structure allows for easy addition of new features without affecting existing ones.

## Best Practices

- Keep components as pure and stateless as possible.
- Use hooks for managing state and side effects.
- Implement proper error handling and loading states.
- Follow consistent naming conventions across the project.
- Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for features.

By adhering to this architecture, we aim to create a maintainable, scalable, and efficient React application.
